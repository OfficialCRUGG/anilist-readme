# AniList readme workflow

> Simple workflow that will add your latests activity into your readme!

## Note

This was made by a person who uses primarly TypeScript and I do not know how to use Python.

## How to

Simply add this to your README.md

```
# My recent AniList activity

<!-- ANILIST_ACTIVITY:start -->
<!-- ANILIST_ACTIVITY:end -->
